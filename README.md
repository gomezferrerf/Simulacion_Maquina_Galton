# Light Interference Simulation in the Double-Slit Experiment Using Galton Machines

This project aims to simulate the phenomenon of light interference in the double-slit experiment using Galton machines. The model uses two Galton machines, each with arrival boxes assigned specific phase values to simulate the superposition of light waves. This simulation allows us to observe the interference pattern and how it varies when adjusting the initial separation between particles.

## Project Description

The double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave nature of light through interference patterns. In this simulation, each of the two Galton machines has multiple "arrival boxes" with assigned phase values. The central box has a phase of 1, and the values alternate between 0 and ±1 toward the edges, simulating the separation between nodes as 1/4 of the wavelength (λ).

At the start of the simulation, you can adjust the separation between the initial particles and the number of rows in each Galton machine, representing the wave behavior throughout its path. The superposition of the results from both machines creates an interference pattern, with opposite-phase values (1 and -1) canceling each other, visually reproducing the behavior of light in the double-slit experiment.
